24: Additional Fee List Module And Linked It to Smartphone For Sale Module With Select input For Selection directly ✅
More Additional Work
As per your suggestions, here’s how I plan to implement the inventory registration flow:

Settings / Configuration Phase ✅
The modules for Brand Name List, Capacity List, Color List, and Storage Location List are already completed, so no further changes are needed here.

Smartphone Module ✅
I will remove the selling price field from this module.
All other fields (brand, capacity, color, image, etc.) will remain unchanged.

Batches Module ✅
All existing columns will remain the same.
I will add a VAT number field.
Functionality will be added to create inventory items directly while registering a batch.
The total quantity will be calculated automatically based on the number of phones added, so manual input is no longer needed.

Inventory List Menu ✅
This already shows all relevant information, including model, batch, storage location, quantity, status, and serial number.
No major changes are needed here.

Product-for-Sale Module ✅
A new module will be created to register products for sale from Smartphone.
Users will select smartphones from the inventory, manually input the selling price, and add any additional fees (similar to extra costs in the batches module).
The final selling price will be automatically calculated at the end.

This approach ensures a smooth, UX-friendly workflow, where purchases are linked directly to inventory, and products can be listed for sale efficiently with accurate cost tracking.





Milestone 3:System Enhancements & Order Flow / Payment Handling

Issue: Sidebar Settings Menu Not Showing On Mobile

Collaborator Module Updates ✅
I will be updating the Collaborator module to include the following missing fields:
Address
Bank Account Number
Manually Point accumulation Rate Input in Collaborator Module For Seprate Rate Tracking And Points Assigning If Not Set than we will take point accumulation rate from settings
These additions will ensure complete information is captured for each collaborator.


Category & Distributor Module  ✅
A Category Module will be created to manage product categories.
Each Distributor will be assigned to a specific category.
When an order is placed for a product in that category, the customer will instantly see the distributor’s account number for payment.
Collaborator Bank Account: Only used internally for paying commissions; not shown to customers.
Distributor Scope: Exclusive to the assigned category or region.
Collaborator Role: Functions as a salesperson or sales company, assisting with orders but not handling customer payments directly.
Commission Rates: Both distributor and collaborator commission rates will be configurable in the settings And Also can be given commission Rates seprately.
Distributors: Predefined per category; no manual assignment needed initially.


Additional Feature – Discount/Reward Points ✅
Super admin can set a point accumulation rate per collaborator.
Customers earn points based on purchase amount.
Points can be used like cash within the site, valid for five years, and automatically deleted if unused.


Invoice Management ✅
Invoice Format: Design is flexible; I will implement it following the required flow and fields.
Invoice Download: Only possible after payment is manually confirmed by the admin. ✅
Tracking Link: Each invoice will include a link at the bottom to dynamically track shipment status from the site. ✅

Invoice Types ✅
Order Form: Basic order details (customer name, address, etc.). ✅
Order Form (+ QR): For domestic shipping in Korea and internal management. ✅
Can be downloaded/printed immediately after payment confirmation. ✅
Now merged with standard order form and sent to customers. ✅

QR Code Usage: ✅
Customer: Can view only allowed order information. ✅
Admin: Can access internal management tools like delivery management and inventory status. ✅
Referral Code Added as an input field when placing an order, along with delivery info. ✅

Purpose: Identifies the collaborator for commission purposes.
Example: A collaborator promotes a product locally and shares their referral code. When used by a customer, the collaborator receives the predefined commission.



Order Flow Implications ✅
Order Creation & Payment: Customer places an order → admin confirms payment. ✅
Invoice Generation: After payment, invoice with QR can be generated and sent to the customer. ✅
Shipping Invoice: QR-enabled order form serves both customer use and internal management. ✅
Referral Code: Used only for collaborator identification for commissions And Points accumulation for the Customer If Referral Code Used Of Any Collaborator. ✅


Order Flow Migration Steps
this is for Website -> Order Creation & Payment – Customer places an order → Automatically shows Bank Details Of Smartphone Related Category Distributor And Than After Payment And Uploading Receipt By The User Admin confirms payment.
Cart CRUD in dashboard  -> will be use for website

Invoice Generation – After payment, an invoice with QR is generated and sent to the customer. ✅
Shipping Invoice – QR-enabled order form serves for both customer use and internal management. ✅
Referral Code Integration – Used only for collaborator identification, commissions, and customer points if applied. ✅
Courier Shipping Upload – Ability to upload courier shipping details for related orders. ✅
Courier Details Management – Courier company name, shipping date, and tracking number. ✅
Payment Receipt Upload (Customer) – Customers can upload proof of payment. ✅
Cash Collected Status Toggle – For internal tracking ✅



Additionally, customers will only earn points when a purchase is made with a collaborator’s referral code entered. ✅
The point accumulation rate can either be set by the super admin as a uniform rate applied to all collaborators, or as different rates per collaborator. ✅

Packaging Recordings ✅ -- Module {
To clarify, the Packaging Recordings module is a straightforward feature: it records video in real time, allows us to assign the recording to the related order, and enables tracking of the viewed status along with the recording timestamp. I believe these are the main points we previously discussed.
Also added cleanup schedular runs after 30 Days
}

Order items Module ✅


🔔 Push Notification Events (Email ✅ + Meta API: Messenger/Instagram)

- Triggered at key status updates:

- Pending – Order placed successfully, awaiting payment
- Paid – Payment confirmed, preparing for shipment
- Shipped – Shipment received by courier (Korea)
- Arrived Locally – Shipment has arrived in local country (e.g., Mongolia)
- Delivered – Order delivered to recipient
- Meta API will be integrated to send push messages for the above events using customer-authorized Messenger/Instagram accounts.

Additional Work:
(
  Made Posts Media Change When Mouse Wheel Rotates Like Mid-Journey Also Ensured Responsiveness ✅
  Made Right Posts Side bar For Switching Posts Also Implemented Mouse Wheel Functionality  ✅
  On mobile, the Escape button sometimes doesn’t work. ✅
  When the text appears, there is a container spacing issue. ✅
  The feature to scroll the text upward with a finger doesn’t work. ✅
  Swiping the text left or right with a finger doesn’t work. ✅
  Website Whole Layout Changed 3 Times ✅
  Search Results Page ✅
  Search History
  Restricting Post Creation title should be atleast 10 chars
  Ad Posts Will be made within the posts Table and its section

  1: The 3 new categories we discussed will be added, and the existing Posts and Products categories will be removed,  ✅
  2: If spatiotemporal information is applied in the filter, we’ll display it below the search bar as a reference,
  3: We’ll also update the category enabling/disabling logic to work with these new categories.  ✅
  4: Implementing AutoLoading Results In Results Page When Scroll✅
  And just to summarize the search logic we finalized:  ✅
  1: Hashtags → exact match (=) — returns posts where the hashtag matches 100%.
  2: URLs → full-string match using LIKE within post content
  3: Search Terms → partial match (LIKE) across post title and content.

  4: Users → exact match (=) — to be implemented later.


Navigation (Latitude/Longitude concept):
- On mobile, navigation should follow a map-like logic:
- Up/Down (Latitude): switch between posts in the feed. ✅
- Left/Right (Longitude): navigate within the gallery/media of a single post. ✅
- On desktop/PC, since swiping isn’t native, I suggest alternatives like:
- Arrow keys / WASD controls for the same movement.
- Or hover/click zones with directional arrows.
- (Optionally, we could explore a small mini-map overlay to make the grid-style navigation more visual.)
Also, about the PC website version (post archive and post single archive) — do you want these to remain exactly the same as now, or should the design/interaction on desktop also be adjusted differently from mobile?

Feed Travel Distance (Geo-based Exposure):
The slider(s) define how far posts are visible based on latitude and longitude ranges.
- Instead of a single slider, there should be two separate sliders:
- One for Latitude range (north/south exposure).
- One for Longitude range (east/west exposure).
These values will be applied to filter the posts/products shown in the feed according to the user’s defined exposure range.

Archive Layouts (Posts vs Products):
- The posts archive will keep the MidJourney-style masonry grid with unresized images for that creative feel.
- The products archive will follow the cleaner PDF-style layout, with optimized and resized images for consistency (as expected in e-commerce).
- On the home archive, posts and products can appear together, but there must also be a filter option to display only products or only posts when needed.

Marking things for clarity:
To make it easier for me and avoid misunderstandings, could you please mark or highlight the elements/sections that should be removed or changed (just like you do when pointing out details) For The Desktop Layout ? This way I’ll have a clear checklist to follow and won’t miss anything.

So in short:
- Navigation → latitude/longitude gestures (mobile) + confirm PC version flow.
- Filtering → latitude/longitude range sliders for exposure.
- Layout → MidJourney style for posts, PDF style for products, filterable in mixed archives.
- Next step → please confirm and mark removals/changes for the Posts Single Archive On Desktop so I can proceed smoothly.

💰 Suggested Budget: $1000
⏱ Time Estimate: 10 - 15 days




For Later
AND have all content—regular posts, product posts, and ad posts (to be implemented later)—appear together,
mixed, in a single home archive page. From there, if someone wants to view only posts or only products, implement filters so they can view them accordingly.
