More Additional Work
As per your suggestions, here’s how I plan to implement the inventory registration flow:

Settings / Configuration Phase ✅
The modules for Brand Name List, Capacity List, Color List, and Storage Location List are already completed, so no further changes are needed here.

Smartphone Module ✅
I will remove the selling price field from this module.
All other fields (brand, capacity, color, image, etc.) will remain unchanged.

Batches Module ✅
All existing columns will remain the same.
I will add a VAT number field.
Functionality will be added to create inventory items directly while registering a batch.
The total quantity will be calculated automatically based on the number of phones added, so manual input is no longer needed.

Inventory List Menu ✅
This already shows all relevant information, including model, batch, storage location, quantity, status, and serial number.
No major changes are needed here.

Product-for-Sale Module ✅
A new module will be created to register products for sale from Smartphone.
Users will select smartphones from the inventory, manually input the selling price, and add any additional fees (similar to extra costs in the batches module).
The final selling price will be automatically calculated at the end.

This approach ensures a smooth, UX-friendly workflow, where purchases are linked directly to inventory, and products can be listed for sale efficiently with accurate cost tracking.
